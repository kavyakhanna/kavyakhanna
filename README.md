## 📌 Featured Projects

### 📊 S&P 500 Sector Profitability Analysis [ https://github.com/kavyakhanna/SP-500-Financial-Analysis/tree/main ]
- Analyzed sector-wise EBITDA and market capitalization
- Applied statistical testing and data visualization
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

### 🚗 Craigslist Car Data Analysis [ https://github.com/UST-631/eda-data-viz-kavyakhanna ]
- Collected and cleaned 2,421+ car listings from Craigslist by handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and invalid entries
- Performed data preprocessing including type conversions, outlier detection, and reduced missingness by ~90% using appropriate imputation techniques
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in car prices, mileage, models, and geographic locations
- Applied statistical inference methods including permutation tests, hypothesis testing, and bootstrapping to evaluate differences in car condition and pricing
- Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

### 🏦 Credit Union History Data Analysis [ https://github.com/UST-631/assignment-bootstrapping-kavyakhanna ]
- Analyzed a 2,400-response credit union survey to study regional attitudes and behavioral trends
- Applied bootstrapping and permutation tests to estimate confidence intervals and compare group differences
- Cleaned and processed real-world survey data and engineered new features (e.g., a progressivism index)
- Visualized key insights to support data-driven interpretation
- Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib


## 🌱 What I Care About
- Building AI systems that are interpretable and reliable
- Using data to support decision-making, not just predictions
- Continuous learning at the intersection of AI and real-world impact
